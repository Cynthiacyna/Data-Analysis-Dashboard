# Nigeria Library Data Analysis & Interactive Excel Dashboard Project (Using Excel)
## Project Overview
Libraries play an essential role in improving literacy, supporting research, and expanding digital access across Nigeria. To better understand library operations and usage patterns, I created a 200-record dataset covering public, private, and academic libraries across major states and cities in Nigeria.
The dataset captures operational metrics, service utilization, digital resource distribution, and user engagement trends. Using this data, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard that gives stakeholders a clear, data-driven view of library performance nationwide.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
At the top of the dashboard, I designed five KPI cards to highlight the most important library metrics:
•	Total Libraries Patrons
•	Average Borrow Days
•	Average Satisfaction Score
•	Total Books Borrowed
•	Total Fines Collected
These KPI cards automatically update when filtered using slicers, making them dynamic and highly responsive.
