# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
In this project, I designed and developed a complete Nigeria Library Dataset and built a fully interactive Excel Dashboard featuring KPI cards, dynamic charts, slicers. The goal was to create a real-world, portfolio-ready analytics solution that demonstrates strong data wrangling, visualization, and dashboard  skills using Microsoft Excel.
